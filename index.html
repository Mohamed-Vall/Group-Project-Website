	<h2>Welcome to our neighborly weather forecast</h2>
	<p>A small web project made by your classmates Christos Maragos, Costantinos.<br>
	Kores and Mohamed Mohamed Vall. This project is a small one, made with<br> 
	testing out unix and other web-based language's functionalities. <br>
	It may not look like much, but we've learned a great deal while working on this project and hope you'll learn to appreciate the work<br>
	we put into it.<br>
	</p>

	<h3>Functionalities</h3>

	<p id="function">
	Although most of the work for this project is happening "behind the scenes" <br>
	(ex: launching this project on a web server, keeping said server open and <br>
	constantly updating, etc.), we've decided to build a few functionalities<br>
	with the hopes of making a robust project every can enjoy. Firstly,<br>
	we've made not one but two (!) variants of a weather forecasting program<br>
	Those being the <a href="Goal.html">Single</a>  and <a href="Goal.html">Multiple</a> daily forecast.<br>
	With that said, we would like to present to you the fruits of our labor.
	</p>

	<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
